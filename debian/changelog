python-debian (0.1.1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * changelog.py:
    - Version class:
      + Subclass debian_support.Version, for rich comparison
      + Changing any attribute now automatically updates any other affected
        attribute (i.e. changing full_version will update all of the other
        attributes; changing debian_version will update full_version)
    - Changelog class:
      + Many "getter" and "setter" methods were replaced with properties (so
        they appear as regular object attributes).  Most set_* methods remain
        for compatibility, and they're the actual set methods for the
        properties anyway.  Please see README.changelog.
      + You can now assign a string to the version attribute, and it will be
        coerced into a Version object
  * README.changelog:
    - Update the documentation to reflect the changes mentioned above
