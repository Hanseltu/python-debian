- Revamp the README files. In particular, note that debian_support.py
  comes from the secure-testing repository (also in copyright!!), and
  that for reading Packages files Deb822 should be used instead.
- parsed dependencies support:
  - add tests
  - change key name to access package name from "name" to "package", that way
    it is more consistent with legacy package names
