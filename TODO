- Revamp the README files. In particular, note that debian_support.py
  comes from the secure-testing repository (also in copyright!!), and
  that for reading Packages files Deb822 should be used instead.
- parsed dependencies support:
  - add tests
  - add examples
  - change key name to access package name from "name" to "package", that way
    it is more consistent with legacy package names
  - instead of adding top-level methods, add a single top-level property
    returning a dictionary of all possible package relationships
  - put in the above dictionary all the possible dependencies, no matter if
    they appear or not in the actual package (at worst they will be empty
    lists), this will simplify using deb822
